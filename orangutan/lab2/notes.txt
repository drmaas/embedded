Use PWM on Timer 2 - OCR2B gets set to the speed you want (-255 to 255)
Modify TOP to change the pwm frequency
See the set_motor_speed orangutan function as an example - /home/drmaas/libpololu-avr/src/OrangutanMotors

04/03/2013:  timer ISR is working
             TODO: work on creating a motor function like set_motor2_speed(<-255 -255>)
             actual speed set in OCR2B is 0-255, and IO_C6 = 0 for forward (PIN_OFF(DIRECTION)), 1 for reverse (PIN_ON(DIRECTION))

04/06/2013:  motor function works for forward, reverse.
             TODO: create functionality to read encoder position and velocity values and set up pin change interrupts on the encoder port pins. set up pin change interrupts on these port pins and count the number of signal changes to track the position of the motor.
             //calculate velocity. position and time variables should be global
             //reference position means for forward/backward by x degrees
             new_p_ref = p_ref + current_position
             long calc_v() {
               prev_position = position; 
               prev_time = time;
               position = encoders_get_counts_m2()*5.625; //gives us position in degrees
               time = get_ticks
               velocity = (position-prev_position)/(ticks_to_ms(time-prev_time));
             }
04/07/2013:  velocity and position from encoder working.
             TODO: work on equation to get to desired position
